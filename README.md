# Generative Art Experiments Repository

Welcome to the Generative Art Experiments repository! This repository is a dedicated space where I explore the limitless possibilities 
of generative art using a range of algorithms and techniques with Python. By experimenting with various tools and pushing the boundaries of my creativity, 
I aim to expand both my coding abilities and my creative horizons. 

# Repository Contents

**camo_generative.py:** This is a Python script that generates unique camouflage patterns using generative techniques. 
The script uses randomness and color manipulation to create visually appealing and distinct designs.

# Future Experiments

This repository will be updated with more generative art experiments as I continue to explore various techniques and tools.
